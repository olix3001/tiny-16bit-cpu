# Tiny 16-bit custom RISC CPU architecture
**Disclaimer:** I have absolutely no frickin' idea what I'm doing.

This project aims at desining a custom RISC CPU architecture with the following:
- Hardware division,
- Primitive cache system,
- Built-in programmable interrupt controller,
- Possible future SIMD instructions.

## Current state
- [x] Basic ALU design
- [x] Register file
- [ ] LSU (Load-Store Unit)
- [ ] PC, CSR, Fetcher & Decoder
- [ ] Programmable Interrupt controller
- [ ] Some kind of cache
- [ ] Multi-core design???
